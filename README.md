## App: Make & share your grocery list!



## Description (Problem and solution)
<b>Problem</b> <br>
The problem is that some people can't go to the supermarket because they aren't stable enough. Think about older people or sick people. For example, at this moment people are staying home because of the corona virus. They can't go anywhere.

<b> Solution </b> <br>
My app offers a simple solution: "unstable" people can make a grocery list and can share this to people who wants to help them. If this is shared, they can use this app while doing groceries. They can "check" every product by adding it to "checked products".  
<br>
So my target audience are people who can't go to the supermarket themselves <b>and</b> people who wants the help this people.


## How does my code work?
Well, to explain my code, I splitted it up in a few parts: <br>
1. The server-side <br>
2. The client-side <br>
3.      <br>

## Progressive Enhancement
<b>What is Progressive Enhancement?</b>
Progressive enhancement (PE) is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. You use the most basic webtechnologies (think about simple HTML and CSS. Users will always have a strong foundation to fall back on as complexity is introduced to the project. The goal is to make the website work for <b>everyone</b>. Think about differents types of users, browsers or devices. After this, you can improve the user experience by adding enhancements. <br>

Web developers need to start with a simple, clean, semantic HTML to navigate through (content of) the application: this is called the first layer. The second layer is CSS. Developers can display or change the visual presentation of the website's content. The third layer is JavaScript. The developers can provide the users an enhanced usability. But don't forget that this part is more about "client" JavaScript, instead of server JavaScript.

"It's a journey from simplicity to complexity". - Sam Dwyer
