## App: Make & share your grocery list!



## Description (Problem and solution)
<b>Problem</b> <br>
The problem is that some people can't go to the supermarket because they aren't stable enough. Think about older people or sick people. For example, at this moment people are staying home because of the corona virus. They can't go anywhere.

<b> Solution </b> <br>
My app offers a simple solution: "unstable" people can make a grocery list and can share this to people who wants to help them. If this is shared, they can use this app while doing groceries. They can "check" every product by adding it to "checked products".  
<br>
So my target audience are people who can't go to the supermarket themselves <b>and</b> people who wants the help this people.
